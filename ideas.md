### Did we know anything that Google didnt!!!

## Break down the aggregate speed data 
* To try and provide some geographical focus
* Demonstrate speed of propagation of congestion around the network and potentially speed of improvement at the end. (Iâ€™ve already got a visualisation for this in mind)
* Reasons behind the fluctuations in the initial few hours
* 95% of scoot loops don't report data between 09:30 and 12:30 on 15th

* First (now second!) version here:- https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwGwrLWk0TYpeThKNVNTZnJJTlk
* Shows from 6am Tuesday until midnight
* Walsall Road looks worst affected
* Queues don't spread evenly, but flow back from the major junctions

## Examine traffic flow data to understand demand
* Do people leave their cars in the city centre and walk home?
* Is demand lower on Tuesday morning, and by how much

* Simple graphs now produced, using the geographically located counters only. (Green is the day in question, Blue is the historic trend. X axis is time in 5 minute periods (divide by 12 to get hour of day)
*  Monday - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwGwrLWk0TYpVzFXRno1R0MtTTA
*  Tuesday - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwGwrLWk0TYpcjY1emNYYXJBc2M
* Traffic flows are generally higher. Is this because of the A38M / M6 being closed?
* Longer morning peak on the Tuesday morning
* Massive peak on the monday afternoon

## Examine car park data
* To find out how many cars are left in the city centre on the Monday
* To see the extent of demand on the Tuesday morning (initially looks like retail car parks are half empty, but business related ones are still quite full)

## Examine cycle counter data (when available)
* Particularly to look at modal shift (and locations) on the Monday morning

## Freight
* Showed it to head of transportation. Wants to know if we have anything on freight
