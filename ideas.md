#Possible Analytical Ideas

##Break down the aggregate speed data 
* To try and provide some geographical focus
* Demonstrate speed of propagation of congestion around the network and potentially speed of improvement at the end. (Iâ€™ve already got a visualisation for this in mind)
* Reasons behind the fluctuations in the initial few hours

##Examine traffic flow data to understand demand
* Do people leave their cars in the city centre and walk home?
* Is demand lower on Tuesday morning, and by how much

##Examine car park data
* To find out how many cars are left in the city centre on the Monday
* To see the extent of demand on the Tuesday morning (initially looks like retail car parks are half empty, but business related ones are still quite full)

##Examine cycle counter data (when available)
* Particularly to look at modal shift (and locations) on the Monday morning
